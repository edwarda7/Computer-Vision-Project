# ComputerVison-Projects

### Install

This project files requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Numpy](http://numpy.org/)
- [dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib)

Following are some links to install OpenCV and dlib on mac, windows and linux:

[OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) - [mac](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-macos/) | [windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/) | [Ubuntu](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/)
[dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib) -   [mac](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-macos/) | [windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-windows/) | [Ubuntu](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/)


### Run

```bash
python {file_name}.py
```  

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## About

Some simple computer vision implementations using OpenCV such as:

- Extracting facial landmarks for facial analysis by applying filters and face swaps.
- Approximating contours, contour filtering and ordering.Segmenting images by understanding contours, circle, and line detection.
- Feature detection (SIFT and ORB) to do object detection and implementing dbject detection for faces and cars.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied to image.
